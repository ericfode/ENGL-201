	abstract={Recent studies show that there is a significant bidirectional nonlinear causality between stock return and trading volume. This research reinforces the results presented previously and we further investigate whether trading volume can significantly improve the forecasting performance of neural networks, or whether neural networks can adequately model such nonlinearity. Neural networks are trained with the data of stock returns and trading volumes from standard and poor 500 composite index (S&P 500) and Dow Jones Industry index (DJI). The results are used to compare with those networks developed without trading volumes. Daily data is applied to train neural networks in order to test whether trading volumes can help in short-term forecasting. Directional symmetry (DS) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are both employed to test the result of robustness. Empirical results indicate that trading volume has little effect on the performance of direction forecasting. Sometimes it may lead to over-fitting. For forecasting accuracy, trading volume leads to irregular improvements.},

	abstract={This paper studies how software agents influence the market behavior of human traders. Software agents with a passive arbitrage-seeking strategy are introduced in a double auction market experiment with human subjects in the laboratory. As a treatment variable, the influence of information on the existence of software agents is investigated. We found that common knowledge about the presence of software agents triggers more efficient market prices when the programmed strategy was employed, whereas an effect of the information condition on behavioral variables could not be observed. When controlling for information on software agents' participation, the introduction of software agents results in lower market efficiency},

	note={ID: 5},
	abstract={This paper extends a previous market microstructure model, where we used Genetic Programming (GP) as an inference engine for trading rules, and Self Organizing Maps as a clustering machine for those rules. Experiments in that work took place under a single financial market and investigated whether its behavior is non-stationary or cyclic. Results showed that the market's behavior was constantly changing and strategies that would not adapt to these changes, would become obsolete, and their performance would thus decrease over time. However, because experiments in that work were based on a specific GP algorithm, we are interested in this paper to prove that those results are independent of the choice of such algorithms. We thus repeat our previous tests under two more GP frameworks. In addition, while our previous work surveyed only a single market, in this paper we run tests under 10 markets, for generalization purposes. Finally, we deepen our analysis and investigate whether the performance of strategies, which have not co-evolved with the market, follows a continuous decrease, as it has been previously suggested in the agent-based artificial stock market literature. Results show that our previous results are not sensitive to the choice of GP. Strategies that do not co-evolve with the market, become ineffective. However, we do not find evidence for a continuous performance decrease of these strategies.},

	abstract={The annual trading agent competition offers agent designers a forum for evaluating programmed trading techniques in a challenging market scenario. TAC aims to spur research by enabling researchers to compare techniques on a common problem and build on each other's ideas. A fixed set of assumptions and environment settings facilitates communication of methods and results. As a multiyear event, TAC lets researchers observe trading agents' progress over time, in effect accelerating the evolution of an adapted population of traders. Given all the participant effort invested, it is incumbent on us to learn as much from the experience as possible. After three years of TAC, we're ready to examine there we stand. To do this, we used data from actual TAC tournaments and some post-competition experimentation. We based our analysis almost entirely on outcomes (profits and allocations), with very little direct accounting for specific agent techniques.},
