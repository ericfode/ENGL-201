	abstract={Recent studies show that there is a significant bidirectional nonlinear causality between stock return and trading volume. This research reinforces the results presented previously and we further investigate whether trading volume can significantly improve the forecasting performance of neural networks, or whether neural networks can adequately model such nonlinearity. Neural networks are trained with the data of stock returns and trading volumes from standard and poor 500 composite index (S&P 500) and Dow Jones Industry index (DJI). The results are used to compare with those networks developed without trading volumes. Daily data is applied to train neural networks in order to test whether trading volumes can help in short-term forecasting. Directional symmetry (DS) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are both employed to test the result of robustness. Empirical results indicate that trading volume has little effect on the performance of direction forecasting. Sometimes it may lead to over-fitting. For forecasting accuracy, trading volume leads to irregular improvements.},

	abstract={This paper studies how software agents influence the market behavior of human traders. Software agents with a passive arbitrage-seeking strategy are introduced in a double auction market experiment with human subjects in the laboratory. As a treatment variable, the influence of information on the existence of software agents is investigated. We found that common knowledge about the presence of software agents triggers more efficient market prices when the programmed strategy was employed, whereas an effect of the information condition on behavioral variables could not be observed. When controlling for information on software agents' participation, the introduction of software agents results in lower market efficiency},

Surprisingly, the introduction of software agents results in lower market efficiency in the no information treatment when compared to the baseline treatment without software agents.}

	abstract={The cost of commercial intermediation (CCI), companying with trade, one of the most common economy activities and permeates the market everywhere, effects the economy enormously, while it may be changed as the web based new trade style adopted. This paper focuses on these changes which will account for the lower CCI, and moreover result in the increased trade amount and decreased price. Using the classical microeconomic model, the effect on currency demands and invest can be calculated then. Moreover, we deduced the conclusion that the market, in itself, has the self-prompt or self-magnify mechanism in informationization process.}

	abstract={The annual trading agent competition offers agent designers a forum for evaluating programmed trading techniques in a challenging market scenario. TAC aims to spur research by enabling researchers to compare techniques on a common problem and build on each other's ideas. A fixed set of assumptions and environment settings facilitates communication of methods and results. As a multiyear event, TAC lets researchers observe trading agents' progress over time, in effect accelerating the evolution of an adapted population of traders. Given all the participant effort invested, it is incumbent on us to learn as much from the experience as possible. After three years of TAC, we're ready to examine there we stand. To do this, we used data from actual TAC tournaments and some post-competition experimentation. We based our analysis almost entirely on outcomes (profits and allocations), with very little direct accounting for specific agent techniques.},
