	abstract={This paper proposes a new strategy on pruning generalized multi-order rules accumulated by Genetic Network Programming with Rule Accumulation (GNP-RA). In the pruning method, the usage of each rule (flagged by variable U) and the number of the days having important information in each rule (flagged by variable N) can be evolved by GA. As a result, the pruned rules with better combinations of variable U and variable N are obtained by the crossover and mutation of these variables. The proposed method is verified through experimental studies in stock markets. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are proved by simulation results.},

	abstract={The trading strategy is an interesting and challenging subfield in the research of the continuous double auction (CDA) market that is the premier trading mechanism in financial exchanges. This paper investigates how the individuals' trading strategies affect the collective outcomes of a CDA market. The k-ZI strategy is examined, in which the value of parameter "k" determines a trader's maximum expected profit. After a series of simulations with different k-ZI traders, the effects of value "k" over the range of [0, 1] on the average transaction price, the price dispersion, the market efficiency, and the trade volume are analyzed regressively. The findings of the paper help us to understand the effect of traders' profitable behaviors on the out performance of a CDA market in detail}

	abstract={This paper analyzes the predictivity and return of the Barmish-Iwarere trading algorithm described in. In the first part of the paper, we study the trade triggering algorithm using either an Ito process model, or real data from indexes and ETFs. It is shown through hypothesis testing that the trigger provides mixed results in predicting the sign of the single trade, for both the Ito process and real indexes. However, we show empirically the trigger is sufficiently good in identifying a trend, while it fails in detecting side movements. In the second part of the paper, the effect of parameters of the feedback controller will be analyzed under various market circumstances, the efficiency of a pre-optimization on the last data will appear controversal. Some changes will be tried with the objective of improving the returns. In particular, the trigger is modified to detect anomalous falls during a rising trend using the estimated volatility.}

	abstract={The expansion of advanced modeling tools, such as neural, evolutionary, fuzzy and hybrid systems, has led to a systematic attempt for their applicability in the challenging stock market field. Today, the ensuing results are admittedly far better than those accomplished by models based on linear or typical nonlinear mathematical approximators; yet, the related trading risk remains at significantly high levels. In quest of innovative approaches, one interesting research direction appears to be the complete analysis and exploitation of various interrelated quantitative and mostly qualitative agents affecting stock market behavior. Based on this criterion, fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) constitute a powerful modeling tool for the development of a stock market forecasting system as they are structured as networks of cause-effect relationships between diverse factors. The subject of this study is aligned with the aforementioned remark; firstly, the recognition of crucial stock market, business and economic agents is attempted, secondly an FCM-based stock market model is designed, and ultimately the feasibility and effectiveness of the real world application is evaluated}

	note={ID: 1},
	abstract={Automatic trading methods are important issues in recent financial markets. In this paper, we compare some genotype coding methods of technical indicators and their parameters to acquire stock trading strategy using genetic algorithms (GAs). In previous works, the locus-based representation is widely used for encoding technical indicators on chromosomes in GAs, and the direct coding is also widely adopted for encoding the parameters of the indicators. However, these conventional methods are not so effective for the GA search. Therefore, we propose a new genotype coding methods, namely the allele-based indirect coding. We examine the performance of the proposed and conventional coding methods in stock trading of twenty companies in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange for recent ten years. In our empirical results, the allele-based indirect coding is superior to the other ones both on the cumulative profits and the computational costs.}

	abstract={The purpose of this paper is to enhance the performance of Genetic Network Programming (GNP) to be used for creating trading rules on stocks, where a new method named GNP with Subroutines has been proposed. Compared to the conversional GNP, a new kind of node named subroutines node is added, which can call subprograms (subroutines) from GNP main programs. This reusable subroutines, which has judgment nodes and processing nodes working like small scale GNP, can evolve concurrently during the evolution of main GNP. In the simulations, the stock prices of different brands from 2001 to 2004 are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

	note={ID: 5},
	abstract={This paper extends a previous market microstructure model, where we used Genetic Programming (GP) as an inference engine for trading rules, and Self Organizing Maps as a clustering machine for those rules. Experiments in that work took place under a single financial market and investigated whether its behavior is non-stationary or cyclic. Results showed that the market's behavior was constantly changing and strategies that would not adapt to these changes, would become obsolete, and their performance would thus decrease over time. However, because experiments in that work were based on a specific GP algorithm, we are interested in this paper to prove that those results are independent of the choice of such algorithms. We thus repeat our previous tests under two more GP frameworks. In addition, while our previous work surveyed only a single market, in this paper we run tests under 10 markets, for generalization purposes. Finally, we deepen our analysis and investigate whether the performance of strategies, which have not co-evolved with the market, follows a continuous decrease, as it has been previously suggested in the agent-based artificial stock market literature. Results show that our previous results are not sensitive to the choice of GP. Strategies that do not co-evolve with the market, become ineffective. However, we do not find evidence for a continuous performance decrease of these strategies.},

	abstract={Some real life dynamic systems are so large and complex that the individuals inside the system can only partially understand their environment. In other words, the dynamic environment is imperfect to its participants. In this paper, by using the stock market as a test bed, we demonstrate an integrated individual learning and social learning model for optimisation problems in dynamic environments with imperfect information. By applying differing levels of social learning process in an evolutionary simulated stock market, we study the importance of social learning on the adaptability of artificial agents in imperfect environments. Comparisons between the integrated individual and social learning model and other evolutionary approaches for dynamic optimisation problems, particularly the memory-based approaches and multipopulation approaches, are also drawn with the emphasis on optimisation problems with imperfect information.}
